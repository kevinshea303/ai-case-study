# Video Game Giant Turned AI Juggernaut
## NVIDIA Debriefing
* Incorporated in 1993
* Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem were the founders of NVIDIA 
* It all started in a diner located in the heart of modern day silicon valley. They were discussing the creation of a computer chip capable of making video games faster and more immersive.
* NVIDIA is funded through several channels like venture capital, government contracts, and stock sales.  
**As of April of 2024  
the tech giant has receievd 31.4 billion in cash investments**
## Initial Audience
``Gamers have been the main focus of GPU related advancements throughout the years.  
After all, that's how their reputation was initally established.
With the incredible advancements NVIDIA has put forth in the AI space, a new market was created...GPUs for AI.  
Just like that a new audience exists.``
## AI Dominance
* NVIDIA is the leader in the current world of AI hardware.  
* According to the NY Times "NVIDIA today accounts for more than 70% of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models."  
* Their hardware sold so well that as of May of 2024 the company expereinced a 64% increase in revenue. 
* For the moment, NVIDIA reigns supreme in the AI chip space. 
## Where do we Find This Hardware
* NVIDIA's H100 chip was a game changer. 
* The H100 was announced in September of 2022, and became the engine  
powering the popular ChatGPT.  
* The majority of the companies in the AI space use NVIDIA's hardware, this includes their competitors to some degree.
## Was it an Accident?
* Quite the contrary. Huang was credited with pushing AI in the early stages of NVIDIA's life cycle establishing this trend early. 
* In 2006 NVIDIA launched CUDA, a computing platform and programming model which allowed developers to use GPUs for general-purpose computing. A crucial moment in time. This served to lay the foundation for AI developments for years to come.
* Throughout the years there were always subtle advancements until things lined up technologically. 
* According to Daniel Newman **CEO of The Futurum Group**  
Huang has been sharing his vision and talking about accelerated computing for over a decade.
## AI Rivals
There are a few companies in the AI domain who may be giving NVIDIA a run for their money in the coming years. Some companies are as follows.  

1) AMD
2) Intel
3) IBM
4) Amazon
5) Google

``` Amazon has pivoted in the right direction. They're working on an AI chip that is competitively priced, and consumes less energy than that of the NVIDIA chips.```

                                            NVIDIA chips can range from 15,000-40,000
